        function counter(){
            var counter = 0;
        
            function IncreaseCounter() {
                return counter += 1;

        alert(counter());
        alert(counter());
        alert(counter());"
    </pre>
    <h3>Ans: <br> 1 <br> 2 <br> 3 <br> 4</h3>
    <h4>Here there are two functions named as IncreaseCounter() is in another function named as counter(). In inner function named as IncreaseCounter(), here counter will increase by 1. but, in IncreaseCounter() variable counter is not decleared, so that it will check in its parent function named as counter() and here counter variable is decleared as counter= 0; so that output will increase by 1 for how much time alert is called. and instead of console.log() alert() is used. alert() is used to display the output in browser window. and this alert() display a alert box with a message and an OK button.  </h4>



    <h2>Q2.</h2>
    <pre>
        let count = 0;
        (function () {
          if (count === 0) {
            let count = 1;
            console.log(count); // What is logged?
          }
          console.log(count); // What is logged?
        })();
    </pre>
    <h3>Ans: <br> 1 <br> 0</h3>
    <h4>Here, Anonymous function is used. A function without name is called as anonymous function. so in function scope there is one variable decleared name as count and there is if condition in which it will check if assigned value and its data type is equal to 0 or not and here this if condition becomes true. and it will print 1 as output. Outside of the anonymous function there is one console.log(count) in which count is given as parameter. but, here this console.log(count) is present outside of the anonymous function so that it will check if there is count variable is present in the global scope. and here one more count variable decleared outside of anonymous function which is present in the global scope as count=0. So, that it will print 0 as output.</h4>

    <h2>Q3.</h2>
    <pre>
        for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            setTimeout(function log() {
              console.log(i); // What is logged?
            }, 1000);
          }        
    </pre>
    <h3>Ans: <br> 3 <br> 3 <br> 3 </h3>
    <h4>Here Asynchronous function is used. which will print the output after or delay by 1 sec.</h4>

    <h2 class="question">Q4. <br> <span  class="take">Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function should accept parameter length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.</span></h2>
    <h3>Ans: Area: 120 </h3>
    <pre>
        function length(L){
            function breadth(B){

    <h3>Ans: 11</h3>

        (function () {
        alert(a);
        })();
    </pre>
    <h3>Ans: 12 </h3>
    <h4>Here, Anonymous function is used. A function without name is called as anonymous function. In function scope in alert property (a) is given as parameter. but, in function scope a is not decleared. that's why it will go and check if variable a is assigned in global scope. and here variable a is assigned in a global scope as a=12; so that the output will be 12. and instead of console.log() alert() is used. alert() is used to display the output in browser window. and this alert() display a alert box with a message and an OK button.</h4>

        x();
    </pre>
    <h3>Ans: 12 </h3>
    <h4>Here, two Anonymous function is used.and it assigned in variable x. inside of 1st Anonymous function another Anonymous function is used which return the alert with parameter (a); but here in this Anonymous function variable a is not decleared so it goes out and check if in its parent function variable x is decleared or not here a is decleared in its parent function so that the output will be 12.  and instead of console.log() alert() is used. alert() is used to display the output in browser window. and this alert() display a alert box with a message and an OK button.  </h4>
